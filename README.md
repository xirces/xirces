### Aspiring Data Scientist

Hello! I'm a student at the Univsersity of Vermont in my Senior year of our Data Science program.
I'm looking right now for concrete experience in the industry at an entry level likely in the form of an internship, but I'm open to anything. I just want to get my hands dirty!
Next year I will be pursuing my Master's Degree in Complex Systems & Data Science at UVM in partnership with the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/).

## Skills
 - Python (Pandas, SK-Learn, Matplotlib, Numpy)
 - R (ggplot, tidyverse, ML packages)
 - SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
 - Java
 - C++
 - Statistics (AB Testing, Inference, Analysis, etc.)
 - ML Techniques (kNN, Rule Learners, Decision Trees, kMeans)

## Experience

I've done projects in and out of class in various contexts and programming languages:
- Client-server guitar marketplace (no longer functional, ceased payment for remote hosting)
- Coding and NLP relating to silences in palliative care conversations
- Analysis of the relationship between steak temping and risk
- Exploration of position fluctuation and the mechanics of F1 racing
