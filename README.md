### Aspiring Data Scientist

Hello! I am an alumnus from the University of Vermont with a M.S. degree in Complex Systems & Data Science, currently based in my hometown of Burlington, VT.
I'm pursuing concrete industry experience in big data at an entry-early level, but I'm open to anything. I just want to get my hands dirty!

## Skills
 - Python (Pandas, SK-Learn, Matplotlib, Numpy)
 - R (ggplot, tidyverse, ML packages)
 - SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
 - Java
 - C++
 - Statistics (AB Testing, Inference, Analysis, etc.)
 - ML Techniques (Supervised & Unsupervised)
 - Deep Learning & AI (Transformers, Neural Networks)

## Experience

I've done projects in and out of class in various contexts and programming languages:
- Client-server guitar marketplace (no longer functional, ceased payment for remote hosting)
- NLP analysis of job postings and course catalogs to quantify the "skills gap" [My Master's Project](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/Xirces_Project)
- Enterprise-level data migration from Microsoft DAX using Oracle Netsuite and Microsoft Azure
- Coding and NLP relating to silences in palliative care conversations
